Too often we find ourselves with just a handful of ingredients we forgot about in our fridge and on the verge of going bad but having no idea what to do with them. 
Do we go out and buy more ingredients so we can add our existing ingredients to the mix? 
Do we scour the web in an attempt to find a decent recipe that uses all of our expiring foods?

What if we had a website that could help keep track of groceries *and* find recipes for us? 

## What It Does

Scan2Serve lets users upload images of their receipts to be put into a table storing attributes such as "item name", "price", "confidence value", and "perishable". 
When parsing the receipt, the AI will ignore non-food items and give a confidence value for each item when decoding the receipt due to its abbreviated nature. 
Once the AI is done, the user has the ability to edit or delete each entry.

On the Recipes page, the user will be able to see all of their perishable food items and have access to a chatbot to ask about potential recipes. 
The user can have as many exchanges as they please, and once they are satisfied with their prompts, 
the AI will return links to recipes the user can use to begin their cooking journey. 
There is also the ability to edit the ingredients available and save recipes the chatbot mentions for later use.
